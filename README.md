# TiAutoSplit
 An auto splitter for TGM3 Ti Master mode.
 As of right now this can predict your COOLs and REGRETs, but it's planned to have more functionality (timer until uncool/regret, current pace, etc)

### Downloading
 1. Download/clone the repo.
 2. Go to `bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1`
 3. Open `TiAutoSplit.exe`. Do not rename, move, or delete any of the files or it will not work.

### Note
- Do not select any text in the console. This stops the program. This is a limitation of Windows' CMD and we cannot do anything about it.
- If you have another process running named `game.exe` other than TGM3, this might not work.
